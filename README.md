## Free starter tier capacity for participants during the hackathon!

Tilebox is happy to provide free starter tier capacity for hackathon participants during the hackathon. This will allow you to access our full suite of APIs and datasets. Simply ping us in person or on our [Discord](https://tilebox.com/discord) and we'll get you set up. We're looking forward to seeing what you build!

## Challenge Overview

### ✈️ Challenge 1: Supersonic Boomless Flight Corridor Mapper

Map the invisible highways in the sky where aircraft can fly at Mach 1.1–1.3 without creating sonic booms that reach the ground.

This is where Mach cutoff physics meets real-time atmospheric modeling, you’ll use temperature and wind gradients to find where shockwaves bend upward and vanish before touching Earth’s surface.

### 🛰️ Challenge 2: Earth Observation Change Detection & Risk Assessment

Your mission: build a multi-temporal change detection + risk assessment system using optical, thermal, or SAR satellite imagery. Choose one scenario (or combine several) and generate a severity/risk map backed by quantitative analysis.

This challenge is ideal for hackers into EO data, climate, disasters, geospatial AI, SAR, spectral indices, and large-scale pipeline design.

### 🌍 Challenge 3: Mini-Constellation Tasking Planner

You’re running a tiny virtual earth-observation constellation — 3 to 6 satellites.
Your mission: Plan the next 24–72 hours of imaging over a target AOI but with real-world constraints:

- Satellites move — you must propagate orbits and compute visibility windows
- Earth rotates — terrain masks, shadows, daylight constraints change constantly
- Weather is in the way — cloud forecasts must be avoided in planning
- Imaging geometry matters — off-nadir angles, sun angle constraints, slews, etc.
- Time is limited — you need the best coverage, not just the first-visible pass
