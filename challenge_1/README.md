# Challenge Briefing: Supersonic Boomless Flight Corridor Mapper

## 🧠 The Core Problem

Supersonic flight over land is banned in most countries due to the loud sonic booms generated by breaking the sound barrier.

### Your mission

Map the invisible highways in the sky where aircraft can fly at Mach 1.1–1.3 without creating sonic booms that reach the ground.

This is where Mach cutoff physics meets real-time atmospheric modeling, you’ll use temperature and wind gradients to find where shockwaves bend upward and vanish before touching Earth’s surface.

## 📦 What You Must Deliver

1. Interactive corridor maps showing viable boomless supersonic routes over selected regions
2. Maximum allowable Mach per route segment
3. Atmospheric profile visualizations (temperature gradients, wind shear, stability layers)
4. Terrain-aware cutoff altitude computations
5. Time-varying maps showing how viable corridors shift throughout the day

## 📂 You Get

- Atmospheric profile datasets (temperature, wind, pressure by altitude)
- Global terrain elevation (DEM)
- Mach cutoff reference equations & physics implementations
- Predefined geographic regions of interest (continental-scale routes)
- Tilebox Datasets + Workflows + Query API access
  - Spatio-temporal queries for reanalysis & forecast data
  - Distributed workflows to compute corridors across spatial grids and forecast timesteps
  - Recursive chunking to parallelize time windows and route segments
  - Autoscaling spot instances for cost-efficient large-scale computation
